#### TOPIC IDEAS

(will be updated upon final decision of the group)

1. Research on how to combine different signals/strategies. As for alpha-seeking strategies, a large number of basic strategies, which are also known as signals, can be combined to construct a portfolio. The benefits are explained by Modern Portfolio Theory. We can figure out an approach to construct the portfolios using machine learning (I am able to provide some signals, with other references).
2. Statistical arbitrage strategy research, which is to find potential trade opportunities in high frequency market data, could be a good application of time-series prediction model. 
3. Market behavior research. Last semester I audited a few classes of Computing in Finance, the professor introduced a research topic of "Market Mimicking", which is to analyze the volatility before/after a market crash.
